; I've implemented one analyze-sequence in eval1.scm,
; the text has a version of analyze-sequence(analyze-sequence-text in eval1.scm)
; and analyze-sequence-alyssa has a version of analyze-sequence(analyze-sequence-alyssa).
; Of those, analyze-sequence-text and my version are better. Since they try to expand all the sequence
; during the analysis stage(try to add a print func in loop).
